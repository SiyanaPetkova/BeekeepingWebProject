INTRODUCTION
Beekeeping Web project is web application developed for beekeeping in Bulgaria. Its purpose is to show users the importance of the bees and helping beekeepers to manage their appairies. 
Like beekeper I wanted to be able to track my apiary data not on a paper but in a modern way. So I decided to give this opportunity to every coleage that needs this. The aaplication is divided into three main parts:
- Beekeeping book
- Financial book
- Statistics

FEATURES
- Adding, updaiting and deleting apiaries as well with showing via OpenMap Api the weather in the users's appiaries
- Adding, updationg and deleting beecolonies as well with keeping track on the inspections during the year
- Detailed information about all aspects of user's apiary
- Showing balance to the costs and the incomes of the user
- Statistics about the apiaries and the financial part
- Separate parts so users can choose what part of the application to use
- Resposnsive and userfriendly design for good user experiance
