<h2 align="center">INTRODUCTION</h2>

Beekeeping Web project is a web application developed for beekeeping in Bulgaria. Its purpose is to showcase the importance of bees and assist beekeepers in managing their apiaries. As a beekeeper, I wanted to move away from tracking apiary data on paper and transition to a modern digital approach. I aimed to provide this opportunity to fellow beekeepers in need. The application is structured into four main sections:
- Beekeeping book
- Financial book
- Statistics
- Entertainment part
